I decided to make a version of a minigame from the video game series Wario Ware.

In this game, there is a controllable character that can move left, move right, and jump. Every round, a car 
comes. The player must jump over the car. You can move left and right in the air. If the player sucessfully jumps
over the car without colliding with it, the point counter goes up and the difficulty is incremented. 
I set it so that every 3 rounds the player wins, the speed of the car increases. 
Also, the car can take one of 4 "paths" each round (static speed, slow-fast, slow-stop-fast, fast-slow-fast). 
The player has three lives, shown in the top left corner. Once the player loses all 3 lives, they are shown a 
losing screen where they can choose to play again.

The controls are: SPACE to jump, LEFT ARROW to move left, RIGHT ARROW to move right, ENTER to restart upon loss

It can be a little tricky at first but once you get a feel for the timing it becomes easier. The trick is to
anticipate what the car will do by its initial movements and get a headstart before jumping.

Here is a list of uniquenesses:
-"platformer" with jump 
-loss screen with option to restart
-dynamic difficulty
-"lives" system
-different method of acquiring points
-different game logic overall
